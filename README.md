# Resonate
A music player and file host.
THIS IS A WIP. 







## Initial Setup :
- First, clone the repo.
- Then run `npm install` (instructions for installing npm can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you dont already have it)

- Then, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```



Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start the Android app:

## Running the App :

### For Android 

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS (Coming Soon!) 

```bash
Support is not available for ios at the moment, but it is actively being worked on.
```

Enjoy!
